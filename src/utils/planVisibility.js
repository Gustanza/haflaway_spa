// Which event plans (packages) an organization may choose from.
//
// The rule is attribute-based rather than a list of org IDs per plan: orgs carry
// commercial segments ("agent", "enterprise"), plans declare the segments they
// serve, and visibility is the intersection. That keeps both frequent operations
// to a single write — onboarding an org grants every plan for its segment
// including ones created later, and launching a plan reaches every org in the
// segment including ones onboarded later. Per-org allowlists would instead make
// onboarding cost one write per eligible plan, which is the operation that
// happens most often.
//
// Shapes:
//   eventPlans/{id}
//     visibility   'public' | 'segments' | 'hidden'   (absent ⇒ public)
//     segments     string[]        — when visibility === 'segments'
//     allowOrgIds  string[]        — override: visible regardless of segments
//     denyOrgIds   string[]        — override: never visible; beats everything
//   organizations/{id}
//     planSegments string[]
//
// Overrides exist for timing ("let this org in early"), not for pricing. An org
// that needs different rates should get its own plan restricted to it, so the
// variation lives in the catalogue rather than accumulating here.
//
// MIRRORED in haflaway_admin_spa/src/utils/planVisibility.js — the two SPAs
// don't share a module tree. Change both together.
